LifeVirus	Nobody can hurt you. You are finally safe.	Fear, Security, Isolation.	Vanish: The Navi temporarily disappears. Nobody knows where they go. When they return, they remember little to nothing about their disappearance, but are ice-cold to the touch.	Undying: The hands of the LifeVirus protect the Navi during CrossSoul, rising from the Navi's back. When you would take damage from an enemy attack, the LifeVirus's hands redirect the attack to a Near target of the LifeVirus' choice. Anyone with a Bond with the Navi upshifts their roll to defend, and is pushed away a range band on hit.	LifeAura	
Gospel	You were weak. You were pathetic. Then I found you.	Power, Impulse, Self-Destruction.	BugCurse: The Navi's code corrupts. Daemon picks 2 bugs: they cannot feel or display emotion; they cannot speak or write; on failing a roll, they take -1 HP; anyone they touch gets a Bond with Gospel; their element is changed to Corruption; they cannot jack out when a known enemy is Near. When you increase your Daemon Bond, fix 1 bug.	BugCharge: During CrossSoul, the Navi's body is riddled with glowing, flickering spots. They are immune to their bugs. When the Navi rolls to damage anything, they add X dice, where X=the # of bugs affecting them.	GraveBreath

Cache	You could have it all back, just like you remember it.	Nostalgia, Denial, Regret.	Haunted: After time passes, the Navi will hear voices and see visions of past regrets. Cache controls them. They look/sound real, and may require a Hard Bravery roll to ignore. They only leave when the NetOp/Navi agree to sacrifice something that the visions demand.	Reversion: During CrossSoul, the Navi grows Cache's ringed horns. They gain the element Memories, which can return anything to how they remember, including creating life. Roll 3+[Daemon Bond] dice to summon and manipulate it. Cache controls any living being created by Reversion.	FlashMemory
