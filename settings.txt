message_help_oops	Deletes the bot message from the user's last valid command

message_help_unknowncommand	I don't know this command or there is no help message for this command.
message_help_chip	Battle Chips are one-use attacks that NetOps slot into their PETs. Your PET's folder space is determined by your **Navi's Mind + Navi's Info + 2**. When making a new character, pick starter Battle Chips equal to your **NetOp's Mind + NetOp's Info + 2**. After a Navi uses a Battle Chip, they need to jack out to make that Battle Chip usable again, or to change your Battle Chip folder. **Folders may not have duplicate Battle Chips, or more than 1 Mega Chip.** This command can display info on Battle Chips.
message_help_ncp	NCPs (Or Navi Customizer Programs) are installable software NetOps can use to modify their Navi! They can give various perks like increasing folder size, granting access to special Navi powers, and more! **Do note that each Navi starts with 3 EB (Exabytes).** This command can display NCPs.
message_help_power	All Navis have Navi Powers: special abilities they can use whenever they like. There are two types: Cost and Roll powers. **Cost powers reduce the listed stat by 1 until jack out.** This command can display navi powers.
message_help_virus	Viruses are programs with simple, animal-like intelligences that wreak havoc across the internet. With lots of different shapes and sizes, some are more dangerous than others. Viruses use powers just like navis, and some even have special passive abilities! **Viruses have data within them that can be downloaded with a blankchip upon deletion.** This command can pull up a basic description on Virus descriptions.
message_help_virusx	This specific command pulls up full stats for viruses, like stats and drops. __This command is more for GMs than players in a session.__
message_help_tag	Viruses and Battlechips have tags that determine how they behave or work in battle.
message_help_rulebook	Pulls up links for the rulebooks.
message_help_bond	Displays bond powers along with points needed, and what they do!
message_help_mysterydata	This command rolls MysteryData and gives you the result automaticlly!
message_help_sense	Study your surroundings, find jack-in ports, and take aim!

message_help_strength	Lift, throw, and punch objects and people!
message_help_speed	Run, jump, and roll places, or out of danger!
message_help_stamina	Endure pain and danger!
message_help_charm	Sweet-talk, feign innocence, and gain allies!
message_help_bravery	Resist fear, intimidate enemies, and inspire your allies!
message_help_affinity	Manipulate your Navi element, and sync your NetOp and Navi!
message_help_parry	A character can try to counter a melee attack with a melee attack of their own, called a **__parry__**. Both parties roll using the appropriate skill, likely Strength. Whoever has the most hits wins, and the loser takes damage equal to the winner’s roll. This damage is not reduced by how many hits the loser rolled.\n\nIf the two characters tie, they have a choice: back out or escalate. Both parties should declare this simultaneously. If both back out, nobody takes damage and the parry ends. If one escalates and the other backs out, the parry ends and the one that backed out is the loser. If both parties escalate, roll to melee attack each other again. Whoever rolls higher is the winner, unless they tie; in which case, the cycle continues until someone comes out on top. \n\nUnless both back out, when the parry ends, the loser takes damage equal to the winner’s strongest attack. However, if the loser backed out, they take half the damage they normally would, rounded up.
